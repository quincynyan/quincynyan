I main JavaScript, currently learning Python, my first language was Java, looking forwards to learn C++. Feel free to reach me out and collaborate with me. DMs are open, but don't really expect to get much help out of me. I'm just a beginner (even though I've been coding for the past 3 years) and it's more plausible that I'll need your help more than you need mine XD. 

All of my repos are free to use. You can copy them, duplicate, do whatever you want. If you want to, message me so that I can help you through my messy dirty spaghetti code (not because I'm angry you're using my code without my permission, I don't really care. They don't have lisenses anyways). Welp, have a nice day!
